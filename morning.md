## Morning Praise
The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned,
That I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary:
He wakeneth me morning by morning,
He wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.
The Lord hath opened mine ear,
and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. (Isaiah 50:4-5)

Hearken unto me,
Ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law;
Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings…
I , even I, am he that comforteth you:
Who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of man that shall die,
and of the son of man which shall be made as grass…
And I have put my words in thy mouth,
and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand,
That I may plant the heavens,
and lay the foundations of the earth,
and say unto Zion [Australia/ Thailand],
Thou art my people. (Isaiah 51:7, 12, 16)

It is of the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed,
Because his compassions fail not.
They are new EVERY morning: GREAT is thy faithfulness.
The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
The Lord is good unto them that wait for him,
to the soul that seeketh him. (Lamentations 3:22-25)

Thou wilt show me the path of life: In thy presence is fullness of joy;
At thy right hand there are pleasures forever more. (Psalm 16:11)

As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness:
I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness (Psalm 17:15)

I foresaw the Lord always [constantly] before my face.
For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope…
Thou hast made known unto me the ways of life;
Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance. (Acts 2:25-28)
