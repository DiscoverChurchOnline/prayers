# Pray for Our Church

Father, in the Name of Jesus, we come into Your presence, giving thanks for Discover Church. You have called us to be a family in Godâ€™s local church, to be saints in the Body of Christ, to be the salt of our hometowns and the light of the world. We recognize that You are God, and everything including Discover Church was made by You and for You. We use our faith to call into being those things that are not as though they were.

We thank You that we all speak the same thing: there is no division among us; we are perfectly joined together in the same mind. Grant unto us, your representatives here, a boldness to speak Your Word which You will confirm with signs following. We thank You that we have workmen in abundance and all manner of cunning people for every manner of work. Each department operates in excellence of ministry and intercession. We have in our church the ministry gifts for the edifying of this body till we all come into the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a mature person. None of our people will be children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.

We are a growing are witnessing body of believers becoming bigger and stronger. We have divine favour and grace. We have a good name in the community and Body of Christ. Father, we thank You for ministry facilities that will more than meet the needs of the ministry You have called us to. Our church is prospering financially. We have everything we need to carry out Your Great Commission and reach our hometowns for Jesus. We have more than enough to serve You and sow to others in need.

We are a people of the Word, Jesus is our Lord, and we are teachable and ready to do. We are a people of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit is our guide, and we are willing to testify, prophesy and glorify Jesus in every opportunity. We are a people of love, the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, so we are forgiving and speak the truth in love. We are lovers of different cultures, friends of sinners, and soul winners.

We are a supernatural church, composed of supernatural people doing supernatural things, for we are laborers together with God. We thank You for Your presence among us and we lift our hands and praise Your Holy Name! Amen.
