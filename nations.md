# Pray for the Nations

Heavenly Father, we come before You in the Name of Jesus on behalf of the nations. We pray for a shield of divine protection over these countries and for insight into and uncovering of all terrorist activity. We rebuke any spirit of fear and terror. It has no place on Earth among the saved.

Father, You said the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord, and like a river of water, You turn it whichever way You choose. So we ask You to direct the heart and mind of the

Australian Prime Minister __Anthony Albanese__,

US President __Donald J. Trump__,

Israeli Prime Minister __Benjamin Netanyahu__,

Japanese Prime Minister __Shigeru Ishiba__,

Canadian Prime Minister __Mark Carney__,

British Prime Minister __Keir Starmer__, and

Thai Prime Minister __Paetongtarn Shinawatra__,

We pray for the wisdom of God that they may make the right decisions. We also pray for their divine strength and spiritual health.

We thank You, Lord, for bringing change to the politics of our nations. Thank You for changing the voices of influence to speak in agreement with Your Word. We ask You to send laborers, filled with the spirit of wisdom and might, to surround our leaders with godly counsel and advice. We also ask You to remove from positions of authority those who stubbornly oppose righteousness and replace them with other leaders who will follow You and Your appointed course for the nations.

Your Word declares that “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,” We receive Your blessing and declare with my mouth that Your people dwell safely in this land and they prosper abundantly. We give thanks that our government is upon Jesus’ shoulder, and knowledge is pleasant to our politicians. Discretion watches over them. Understanding keeps them and delivers them from the way of evil men. Lord, give them a heart to do Your perfect will, and direct their decisions for the benefit of the Gospel, churches and families. Expose corruption, evil plots, secret agendas, and purge our land of godless men like Esther did to Haman.

You said in Your Word that if Your people would humble themselves, and pray, and turn from their wicked ways, You would heal the land. So Lord, we repent for the sins of these nations. We ask that You would cleanse us and forgive us for idolatry, witchcraft and every kind of disobedience. Grant these nations a spirit of repentance and cover us with Your mercy. As we turn back to You, Lord, we believe the lands are being healed.

As we enter the final hours of the last days, we ask for the spirit of faith, the working of miracles, signs, wonders, gifts, and demonstrations of the Holy Spirit to be in strong operation. Let believers in our homeland and in every land be unified to stand strong by faith in Jesus, the Anointed One and His Anointing, that Your glory may be revealed in all the Earth.

We thank You that the good news of the Gospel is published in our land, and Your Word prevails and grows mightily in the hearts and lives of the people. Christian TV, radio, publications, websites and public meetings grow unhindered, unobstructed and uncensored. We declare that Jesus is Lord over the Great South Land of the Holy Spirit, Australia; the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, the United States; the Apple of God's Eye, Israel; the Land of the Rising Sun, Japan; the Old Dominion, Canada; You are Thailand's Nation, Religion, King; and the Unity of the Faith to the United Kingdom.

Thank You, Lord, that these requests come to pass. We believe we receive, in Jesus’ Name. Amen!
