# Warfare Prayer

Heavenly Father, I bow in worship and praise before you. I cover myself with the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ as my protection. I surrender myself completely and unreservedly in every area of my life to You. I take a stand against all the workings of satan that would hinder me in my prayer life. I address myself only to the True & Living God and refuse any involvement of satan in my prayer.

Satan, I command you, in the Name of Jesus Christ, to leave my presence with all your demons. I bring the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ between you and me.

Heavenly Father, I worship You and give You thanks and praise. I recognize by faith that You are worthy to receive all glory and honour and praise. I renew my allegiance to You and pray that the blessed Holy Spirit would enable me in this time of prayer. I am thankful, Heavenly Father, that You loved me from past eternity and that You sent the Lord Jesus Christ into the world to die as my substitute. I am thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ came as my representative and that through Him You have completely forgiven me; You have given me eternal life; You have made me the righteousness of God in Him so that I am now reconciled. I am thankful that You have made me complete, and that You have offered Yourself to be my daily help and strength.

Heavenly Father, open my eyes that I may see how great You are and how complete Your provision is for this day. I am thankful that the victory the Lord Jesus Christ won for me on the Cross and in His Resurrection has been given to me and that I am seated with the Lord Jesus Christ in the heavenlies. I take my place with Him in the heavenlies and recognize by faith that all wicked spirits and satan himself are trodden under my feet. I declare, therefore, that satan and his wicked spirits are subject to me in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

I am thankful for the Armour You have provided. I put on the Girdle of Truth, the Breastplate of Righteousness and of Love, the Sandals of the Gospel of Peace and the Helmet of Salvation. I lift up the Shield of FAITH against all the fiery darts of the enemy; and I take in my hand the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, which is sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, discerning between the thoughts of the mind and the intents of the heart. I choose to use Your Word against all the forces of evil in my life. I put on this Armour and live and pray in complete dependence upon You, Blessed Holy Spirit.

I am grateful, Heavenly Father, that the Lord Jesus Christ spoiled all principalities and powers and made a show of them openly and triumphed over them in Himself. I claim all victory for my life today. I reject all the insinuations, and accusations, and temptations of satan. I affirm that the Word of God is true and I choose to live today in the light of Godâ€™s Word. I choose, Heavenly Father, to live in obedience to You and in fellowship with Yourself. Open my eyes and show me the areas of my life that do not please you. Work in me to cleanse me from all ground that would give satan a foothold against me. I do in every way stand into all that it means to be Your adopted child and I welcome all the ministry of the Holy Spirit.

By faith and in dependence upon You I put off the old man and stand into all victory of the Crucifixion where the Lord Jesus Christ provided cleansing from the old nature. I put on the new man and stand into all victory of the Resurrection and the provision He has made for me to live above sin.

Therefore, today I put off the old nature with its selfishness and I put on the new nature with its love. I put off the old nature with its fear and I put on the new nature with its courage. I put off the old nature with all its deceitful lusts and I put on the new nature with its righteousness, purity and honesty.

In every way I stand into the victory of the Ascension and Glorification of the Lord Jesus Christ, whereby all principalities and powers were made subject to Him. I claim my place in Christ as victorious with Him over all the enemies of my soul. Blessed Holy Spirit, I pray that You would fill me. Come into my life, break down every idol and cast out every foe.

I am thankful, Heavenly Father, for the expression of Your will for my daily life as You have shown me in Your Word. I, therefore, claim all the will of God for today. I am thankful that You have blessed me with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. I am thankful that You have begotten me unto a living hope by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. I am thankful that You have made a provision so that today I can live filled with the Spirit of God with love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, meekness, faithfulness, and self-control in my life. I recognize this is Your will for me and I therefore reject and resist all the endeavours of satan and his wicked spirits to rob me of the will of God. I refuse in this day to believe my feelings and I hold up the Shield of Faith against all the accusations and distortion and insinuations that satan would put into my mind. I claim the fullness of the will of God for my life.

In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I completely surrender myself to You Heavenly Father, as a living sacrifice. I choose not to be conformed to this world. I choose to be transformed by the renewing of my mind, and I pray that You would show me Your will and enable me to walk in all the fullness of Your will today.

I am thankful, Heavenly Father, that the weapons of my warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, to the casting down of imagination and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and I bring every thought into obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, in my own life today I tear down the strongholds of satan and smash the plans of satan that have been formed against me. I tear down the strongholds of satan against my mind, and I surrender my mind to You, Blessed Holy Spirit. I affirm, Heavenly Father, that You have not given me the spirit of fear but of power, love and a sound mind. I break and smash the strongholds of satan formed against my body today; I give my body to You recognizing that I am Your temple. I rejoice in Your mercy and goodness.

Heavenly Father, I pray that now and through this day You would strengthen and enlighten me; show me the way satan is hindering and tempting and lying and distorting the Truth in my life. Enable me to be the kind of person that would please You. Enable me to be aggressive in prayer and Faith. Enable me to be aggressive mentally, to think about and practice Your Word, and to give You Your rightful place in my life.

Again I cover myself with the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and pray that You, Blessed Holy Spirit, would bring all the work of the Crucifixion, all the work of the Resurrection, all the work of the Glorification and all the work of the Pentecost into my life today. I surrender myself to You. I refuse to be discouraged. You are the God of all hope. You have proven Your power by resurrecting Jesus Christ from the dead, and I claim in every way this victory over all satanic forces in my life. I pray in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ with thanksgiving. Amen.
